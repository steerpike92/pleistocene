Add elevations to mixtures

Actually, it might be easier to just keep all of the mixture functionality intact and inherit

Say a new class "material-layer" which owns a mixture includes auxiliary mixture fuctionality

creating a material layer...

Really what we have is a column of material layers, starting from the bedrock is simplest as then,
 the system only goes upwards.

So in order of creation:
	Becrock
	Substratum (dynamic layer count)
	Subsoil
	Topsoil

	(optional water column)
	(Aphotic layer) (dynamic layer count)
	(Photic layer)

	Boundary layer
	Troposphere (dynamic layer count)
	s3	5


It's a bidirectional linked list
