cool idea:

q: earth readout
w: horizon readout
e: sea readout
r: air readout

1: layer 0
2: layer 1
3: layer 2
...

that way you can scroll through all the the layers in the simulation



june 15 note:


in order for the draw map to make sense we will need to have the average and a reasonable standard of deviation.

average can perhaps just carry over from the (previous round's total)/ (number of tiles with said layer)

standard of deviation is just and average of ... you know. the individual standards of deviation.

its really just 2 more little calculations per tile


it can be quite generic too.

call -dataDraw
		
		static totalData++
		static dataContributers++

		-if first_round==true
			draw old
			return;
		-else
			standard_of_deviation= standardOfDeviationCalc(myValue);
			draw(anamoly_from_standard_of_deviation);
			return;
