	horizon relations

conduction accross surfaces
radiation banking (implemented though equilibriums)
cross surface pressure flow 
inertia 
graphically representing cross surface pressure flow (vector arrows?) ===done
lets graphically represent advection (horizontal motion) and convection (vertical motion) seperately
convection can easily fit under the model of what flow currently looks like 
advection requires arrows

A major flaw in the way I've handled climate is that I've set things up to be easy(ish) to program.
Instead I should have probably set things up to mesh well with known mathematical climate models.
That way I could have deferred figuring out how weather works to the people who know how weather works.

However not all is beyond hope. If encapsulated well it is easy to change the mathematical underpinning
of a model without requiring undue refactoring.


Also, the model fits very cleanly with finite volume methods.
